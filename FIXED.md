## 🎉 What Was Fixed

### Issue: `BookMarked is not defined` Error

**Error Message:**
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: BookMarked is not defined at AnalysisPage (AnalysisPage.jsx:465:22)
```

**Root Cause:**
- When I removed the References tab, I also removed the `BookMarked` icon from imports
- However, the Critique tab was still using `BookMarked` icon
- This caused a runtime error when trying to render the Critique tab

**Solution:**
1. ✅ Added `Star` icon to imports from lucide-react
2. ✅ Replaced `<BookMarked>` with `<Star>` in Critique tab (line 465)
3. ✅ Replaced `<BookMarked>` with `<Star>` in Critique loading state (line 540)
