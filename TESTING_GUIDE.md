## 🎯 How to Test

### Step 1: Upload a Paper
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/
2. Upload a research paper
3. Wait for analysis to complete

### Step 2: Open Chat
1. Click the **chat icon** (message bubble) in the top right
2. The AI Research Assistant will open with a personalized welcome

### Step 3: Ask Questions
Try these example questions:

**About Methods:**
- "What methodology did the authors use?"
- "Explain the experimental design"
- "How did they collect data?"

**About Findings:**
- "What are the key findings?"
- "What evidence supports the main conclusions?"
- "What results were unexpected?"

**About Context:**
- "What problem does this paper address?"
- "How does this compare to previous research?"
- "What are the limitations?"

**About Implications:**
- "What are the practical applications?"
- "What future research is suggested?"
- "What are the implications for the field?"

### Step 4: Test Features
- ✅ Send multiple messages (conversation history maintained)
- ✅ Watch real-time streaming responses
- ✅ Test error recovery (disconnect internet, then retry)
- ✅ Clear chat and start fresh
